   Some random personal project
</p>

---
#### Description
It started as a uni assignment and im using it as a way to learn and exercise some new things.

It is a simple project that has 2 executables. 2 Little programs that communicate to each other thru some common files. 

The first acts as a store manager and the user is able to add/modify objects in the inventory, it can see the list of orders and it can see the feedback that the customers write about the store.

The second program is supposed to be the *interface* that the customer uses. There is a cart where items can be added, modified or deleted and also the option to leave a review.

It only works on windows. (for now)
